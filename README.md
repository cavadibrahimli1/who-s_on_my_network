### Who's on my Network

This program is designed to help users see all the devices that are currently connected to their network. It provides information about each device, including its IP address, MAC address, and device type.

Before you can use this program, you must first download the required libraries listed in the requirements.txt file. To do this, navigate to the directory where you have downloaded the program and run the following command:
```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt

```

The program will then begin to scan your network and display a list of all the devices it finds. You can use this information to identify any devices that you do not recognize or that may be causing issues on your network.
